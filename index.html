	<h1><span>Jessica Hyman runs Forum</span>. A women's mentoring group rooted in the philosophy that we need the
		support of a community to become our full-voiced selves. For a lot of us that means an
		understanding of how we are feeling, what we are needing and the ability
		to express ourselves in a confidential space. Forum will draw out our strengths and help support our
		areas of weakness. From the observations of our group (never advice), we can gain a deeper awareness
		of how we are wired and what we need to find our inner happiness.</h1>

	<p>Your Forum is a unique space to be real. Lay it all out there. And for that shared experience and safety
		to be what brings a sense of belonging.</p>



		<!-- is currently Chief of Staff and the Project Management Officer
		for the Chief People Officer at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com">Atlassian</a>.
		Jessica is a former global operations lead specialising in <a href="http://www.bsr.org">corporate
		social responsibility</a>. She's consulted on issues ranging
		from employee engagement, women's empowerment and collaborative office space design.
		She is also on the board of <a href="http://girlsontherun.org">Girls on the Run Bay Area</a>
		and continues to build community through the <a href="http://sfcyclingclub.org">SF Cycling Club</a>.</h1> -->

	<h3>How does it work?</h3>

	<p>It starts with commitment. We're all busy but Forum is something you prioritize. The sessions
		are facilitated by Jessica but members are encouraged to develop skills by being a session host.</p>

	<p>We use a highly structured format to ensure each person has an opportunity to share, in a confidential and
		safe environment, their current challenges, aspirations and frustrations. The group learns from each others
		shared experiences and approaches to problem solving. Again, there is no advice giving. We are here to
		listen and learn from each others experiences.</p>

	<h3>How is Forum different from &ldquo;girls weekend&rdquo; or book club?</h3>

	<p>No bachelorette or new mama shenanigans. The focus isn&rsquo;t on any one person, in fact we make sure
		that introverts and extroverts share the same floor space. And unlike your work offsite we are
		going to get personal. The space we are going to create together will stand alone as a place to
		bring the issues in life that cross all boundaries and do not have a home elsewhere - the highest
		highs and lowest lows. If we do it right, we will be authentic, where what&rsquo;s happening inside is
		matched by what is coming out on the outside.</p>

	<h3>Holy commitment, what am I getting into?</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>A small group of 6-8 women at the same life milestones.</li>
		<li>An annual weekend retreat</li>
		<li>Meet once a month in the city for a 3 hour facilitated forum session</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>A bit of background</h3>

	<p>Vince has been running Principles Forum for several years which focused more on young
		CEOs which tend to be all men. We are leveraging Vince&rsquo;s experience, philosophy and
		structure but applying it to a different group of new leaders (you!).</p>

	<h3>Cost</h3>

	<p>Forum is $1,500/year. This includes all expenses associated with the weekend retreat and
		facilitation of forum over 12 months. If your company covers professional development you can spend
		it on Forum. Forum is a peer to peer women leadership mentoring group. We will not only help
		manage critical issues that come up in your professional life but also help you develop
		better communication skills for critical conversations and collaboration.</p>
